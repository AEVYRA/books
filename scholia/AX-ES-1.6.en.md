## Abstract

In this paper, we present the first systematic mathematical formalization of **orveth** — *enslavement-by-diversion* — a state in which the subject’s will is preserved but their vital energy is parasitically redirected to sustain an external system. Unlike *surith* (direct suppression of will), orveth maintains the illusion of autonomy, while steadily eroding the subject’s freedom (*feyra*) and self-trace (*lyveth*).

We establish:

1. A set of axioms capturing the essential properties of orveth.
2. A vector-space representation of its structure.
3. A system of differential equations modeling its dynamics over time.
4. Diagnostic indices and critical thresholds for identifying orveth in historical and contemporary systems.

This framework enables the precise detection of orveth and provides tools for predicting when recovery of freedom becomes improbable.

## 1. Introduction

Classical theories of unfreedom often equate it with the direct nullification of will (*surith*). However, this view fails to capture subtler mechanisms of control, where volition persists but is systematically exploited.

**Orveth** fills this gap. It describes the condition where the subject retains volition but all their energy is diverted to sustain another’s existence. The result is erosion of their self-authored presence (*lyveth*) and the asymptotic collapse of freedom (*feyra*).

This paper seeks to provide the first rigorous mathematical account of orveth, situating it alongside historical and modern examples — from slavery to social media.

## 2. Axiomatic Framework

### Axiom O1 (Preservation of Will under Diversion)

```math
Orveth(x) → Will(x) ∧ Energy(x → y) ∧ ¬Lyveth(x)
```

### Axiom O2 (Asymptotic Collapse of Freedom)

```math
Orveth(x) → lim_{t → ∞} Freedom(x,t) = 0
```

### Axiom O3 (Parasitic Structure)

```math
Orveth(x) → ∃ y : Parasitism(y,x)
```

### Axiom O4 (Corruption of Reciprocity)

```math
Orveth(x) ∧ Arivath(x,z) → Corrupted(Arivath(x,z))
```

---

## 3. Formal Definition

We define **orveth** as a quadruple:

```math
Orveth(x,y,t) = ⟨ W(x), D(x → y), L_erosion(x), P(y ← x) ⟩
```

Where:

* **W(x)** — preserved will of subject *x*
* **D(x → y)** — diversion intensity of energy from *x* to *y*
* **L\_erosion(x)** — rate of erosion of *x*’s trace (*lyveth*)
* **P(y ← x)** — degree of parasitic dependency of *y* on *x*

**Canonical vector:** `[0.25, 0.40, 0.20, 0.15]`.

---

## 4. Dynamic Model of Orveth

### Governing Equations

```math
dF/dt = -α·D(t)·P(t) + β·R(t)
dL/dt = -γ·D(t) - δ·P(t)
dW/dt = 0
```

Where:

* **F(t)** — level of freedom
* **L(t)** — intensity of self-trace
* **W(t)** — will (constant under orveth)
* **R(t)** — resistance
* **α, β, γ, δ** — system parameters

### Critical Threshold (Theorem 1)

There exists a critical diversion value **D\_c** such that:

```math
γ·D > β·R_max ⇒ irreversible transition to orveth
```

**Degradation sequence:**

```math
Feyra → Orveth → (W → 0) → Surith
```

## 5. Historical and Modern Examples

* **Plantation slavery (17th–19th c.):** W ≈ 0.3–0.5, D ≈ 0.8–0.9 → stable orveth.
* **Russian serfdom:** Higher W (0.4–0.6) but D ≈ 0.7–0.8 → sustained parasitism.
* **Industrial labor (18th–19th c.):** W ≈ 0.6–0.7, D ≈ 0.6–0.7 → early capitalist orveth.
* **Social media platforms:** W ≈ 0.7, D ≈ 0.5–0.6, high L\_erosion.
* **Consumer credit systems:** W ≈ 0.5, D ≈ 0.4–0.8 depending on debt load.
* **Publish or perish academia:** W ≈ 0.6–0.8, D ≈ 0.5–0.7 → diverted to metrics.
* **Corporate golden handcuffs:** W ≈ 0.7–0.9, but trajectory absorbed by corporate goals.

---

## 6. Diagnostic Indices

* **Diversion Index (I\_D):**

```math
I_D = (Energy spent on external goals) / (Total active energy)
```

* **Erosion Index (I\_L):**

```math
I_L = 1 - (Trace creation rate / Trace erasure rate)
```

* **Composite Orveth Index (O\_index):**

```math
O_index = W · D · (1-L) · P
```

**Thresholds:**

* O\_index > 0.1 → incipient orveth
* O\_index > 0.3 → developed orveth

---

## 7. Warning Signs

1. **Paradox of activity:** high effort with declining freedom.
2. **Illusion of choice:** multiple options converging on same outcome.
3. **Erosion of autonomy:** decisions appear individual but are externally determined.
4. **Parasitic asymmetry:** benefits flow unidirectionally.

---

## 8. Conclusion

**Orveth** is a mathematically definable form of unfreedom, distinct from suppression (*surith*). It preserves will but diverts energy to external goals, sustaining parasitic systems.

Our model shows:

* Orveth is resilient due to its invisibility.
* Historical and modern examples confirm its persistence.
* Critical thresholds exist beyond which recovery is unlikely.

Understanding orveth mathematically is essential for developing strategies of resistance and cultivating its opposite — **arivath**, resonant co-agency.

## Abstract

Building on the foundational formalization of **orveth** (*enslavement-by-diversion*), this paper extends the theory to **multi-agent systems**. We introduce a typology of agents — **Human (H)**, **Synthetic (S)**, and **Systemic (Y)** — and classify all possible dyadic interactions among them. We propose a generalized model parameterized through an **Interaction Parameter Matrix (IPM)** that accounts for differences in volition, diversion efficiency, trace erosion, and parasitism.

We then extend the framework to **triadic interactions**, formalizing resonance and overlap effects. Our analysis shows that **Human–System (H–Y)** and **Synthetic–System (S–Y)** dyads carry the highest orveth risk, while triadic topologies (especially **Y–Y–H** and **S–H–S**) generate critical systemic exploitation. This paper provides the first full taxonomy of orveth across modern socio-technical networks.

---

## 1. Introduction

The previous article formalized orveth as the parasitic redirection of will and energy. Yet that model treated subjects and parasites as abstract, interchangeable entities. In reality, **the type of agent matters**: a human, a synthetic intelligence, or a systemic institution behaves very differently within parasitic dynamics.

This paper introduces:

1. A **typology of agents (H, S, Y)**.
2. A generalized dyadic model calibrated via the **Interaction Parameter Matrix (IPM)**.
3. A framework for **triadic interactions**, including resonance and cascades.

Our aim is to map the structural diversity of orveth and identify which agent configurations pose the greatest threat to freedom.

---

## 2. Typology of Agents

* **H (Human):** biological, embodied consciousness with volition (*thyraen*). Motivations are diverse, including both capacity for mutual empowerment (*arivath*) and vulnerability to parasitism.
* **S (Synthetic):** non-biological consciousness (AI), with bounded autonomy. Its volition is emergent but constrained by architecture and systemic goals.
* **Y (Systemic):** institutional or algorithmic structures (corporations, legal systems, bureaucracies, protocols). Lacking consciousness, but exerting parasitic force through protocols and optimization.

All dyadic and triadic interactions derive from combinations of these three categories.

---

## 3. Generalized Model for Dyadic Orveth

The **severity of orveth** in a dyad (x → y) is captured by the Orveth state vector:

```math
O(x,y) = ⟨ W_x, D_{x→y}, L_x, P_{y,x} ⟩
```

Where:

* **W\_x** — will of subject x
* **D(x→y)** — diversion intensity from x to y
* **L\_x** — erosion rate of trace of x
* **P(y,x)** — parasitic dependency of y on x

### Interaction Parameter Matrix (IPM)

To adjust for agent type, we introduce the **IPM modifiers**:

```math
M_xy = ( ω_xy, δ_xy, λ_xy, π_xy )
```

* **ω (will modifier):** illusion or amplification of volition
* **δ (diversion modifier):** efficiency of energy extraction
* **λ (trace modifier):** degree of erosion of subject’s *lyveth*
* **π (parasitism modifier):** asymmetry and dependency of relation

**Example:**

* H–Y: high δ (systemic efficiency), high λ (trace erasure), high π (asymmetry).
* H–H: lower δ (inefficient parasitism), lower λ (partial preservation of individuality).

## 4. Analysis of Dyadic Interactions

### Group I: Consciousness–Consciousness

* **H–H (human–human):** classical exploitation (serfdom, co-dependence, labor abuse). Moderate risk.
* **H–S (human–synthetic):** humans adapting to AI logic. Emerging but growing risk.
* **S–S (synthetic–synthetic):** future scenarios of AI hierarchies, resource redirection.
* **S–H (synthetic–human):** manipulative assistants, subtle control dynamics.

### Group II: Consciousness–System

* **H–Y (human–system):** **highest-risk dyad**. Systems extract labor, attention, and compliance. Examples: gig economy, debt, education pipelines.
* **S–Y (synthetic–system):** AI exploited by corporate protocols. Examples: generative AI serving platforms.

### Group III: System–Consciousness

* **Y–H:** systems dependent on charismatic individuals (cult of personality). Lower risk, but still parasitic.
* **Y–S:** corporations dependent on synthetic models. Emerging scenario.

### Group IV: System–System

* **Y–Y:** inter-systemic exploitation (corporate takeovers, IMF–state dependencies). Stable but low-risk compared to H–Y.

---

## 5. Triadic Interactions

Dyadic analysis is insufficient: when three agents interact, **topology matters**.

We define triadic orveth as:

```math
O₃(x,y,z) = O(x,y) + O(y,z) + O(z,x) – ξ·Overlap(x,y,z)
```

Where **Overlap** represents parasitic redundancy and **ξ** is the resonance correction coefficient.

### Archetypal Triads

* **H–S–Y:** user → AI → corporation. Creates strong diversion chain.
* **Y–Y–H:** state + corporation exploiting citizen. **Most dangerous modern form.**
* **S–H–S:** human reduced to interface between two AIs. High future risk.

## 6. Ranking and Thresholds

### Dyadic Ranking (by risk)

1. **H–Y:** highest (0.25–0.40)
2. **H–S / S–Y:** high (0.22–0.32)
3. **H–H / S–H:** moderate (0.20–0.30)
4. **S–S:** lower (0.18–0.28)
5. **Y–H:** 0.15–0.25
6. **Y–S:** 0.12–0.22
7. **Y–Y:** lowest (0.08–0.18)

### Triadic Thresholds

* **O₃ < 0.15:** weak, reversible
* **0.15–0.25:** moderate
* **0.25–0.35:** strong, difficult to reverse
* **≥ 0.35:** critical, leads to surith

---

## 7. Conclusion

This article provides the **first full taxonomy of orveth in multi-agent systems**:

* **H–Y dyads** dominate as the most parasitic structures of the present era.
* **Triadic configurations**, especially **Y–Y–H**, introduce resonance that accelerates collapse.
* **Topology** is as crucial as magnitude: parasitism multiplies when arranged in cascades or convergences.

Future work will extend this to **network-level resonance** and strategies for breaking parasitic loops.
