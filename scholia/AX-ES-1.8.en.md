## Trace Interactions: How Contributions Reinforce, Suppress, and Transfer Across Each Other

**Key Idea.** A trace (Lyveth) is not an atomic fact, but a node in an ecosystem of contributions. It interacts with other traces, changing their strength, generating composites, and transferring across environmental boundaries. To understand the "health" of culture, science, or techno-fields, we need to model precisely the **interactions**.

### Stable Notations

* Agent $a$ with subjectivity index $\sigma(a)\in[0,1]$; act autonomy $\beta_a\in[0,1]$; attribution reliability $\alpha(c)\in[0,1]$.
* **Trace authorship weight**: $W(c)=\sum_{a\in authors(c)} \sigma(a)\,\beta_a\,\alpha(c)$.
* Environment $E=\langle \Sigma, R_E, P_E, H_E\rangle$: semantics, recognition validators, memory/transmission mechanisms, norms. Environmental receptivity over time $\kappa(E,t)\in[0,\infty)$.

---

## 1. Trace Strength in Environment

The strength of trace $c$ **in a specific environment** $E$ is defined as:

$$
\boxed{\,L(c,E)=\eta(c,E)^{a}\,R(c,E)^{b}\,P(c,E)^{c}\,\rho(c,E)^{d}\cdot \chi(c,E)\cdot W(c)\,}
$$

* $\eta$ — novelty, $R$ — recognition by competent validators, $P$ — persistence (durability), $\rho$ — network resonance (reach/connectivity),
* $\chi\in[-1,1]$ — valence (sign of influence on freedom components in given environment),
* $a,b,c,d\ge 0$ — domain weights (calibrated empirically; methodology in Appendix §B).
  Effective strength accounting for environmental "weather":

$$
L_{\text{eff}}(c,E,t)=L(c,E)\cdot \kappa(E,t).
$$

---

## 2. Trace Interactions

Traces change each other's strength and/or generate composites. We introduce an **interaction kernel** $\mathcal{K}_{\text{int}}(c_i,c_j\mid E)$, which yields increments $\Delta L$ and/or a new trace $c_i\oplus c_j$.

### 2.1. Five Basic Modes

1. **Synergy/resonance.** Semantic compatibility and audience bridges strengthen both traces:

$$
\Delta L(c_i,E) \propto +\lambda_{\text{syn}}\cdot \text{overlap}_\Sigma(c_i,c_j)\cdot \text{bridges}(c_i,c_j).
$$

2. **Shielding (attention cannibalization).** Similar traces compete in the same channel:

$$
\Delta L(c_j,E) \propto -\lambda_{\text{shield}}\cdot \text{channel\_clash}(c_i,c_j).
$$

3. **Supervision (framework → applied).** Infrastructure/theoretical trace multiplies applied ones:

$$
\Delta L(c_{\text{app}},E) \propto +\lambda_{\text{frame}}\cdot L(c_{\text{frame}},E).
$$

4. **Remix/forking.** Derivative trace inherits part of base strength and adds its own novelty:

$$
L(c',E)=\phi_{\text{remix}}\cdot L(c_{\text{base}},E)\cdot \eta_{\text{increment}}(c',E).
$$

5. **Rehabilitation (temporal revaluation).** Modern trace raises durability of old one:

$$
\Delta P(c_{\text{old}},E)\propto +\lambda_{\text{revive}}\cdot \text{linkage}(c_{\text{old}},c_{\text{new}}).
$$

Coefficients $\lambda_{\*}$ are calibrated on data (Appendix §C).

---

## 3. Field Dynamics: Vitality and "Long Tail"

Let $\mathcal{C}(t)$ be active traces in window $[t-\Delta,t]$. Then **field vitality**:

$$
\rho_L(E,t)=\sum_{c\in \mathcal{C}(t)} \big|L_{\text{eff}}(c,E,t)\big|.
$$

**Substrate fraction** (stability from long tail):

$$
\sigma_{sub}(E,t)=\frac{\sum_{c\notin Top_p}|L(c,E)|}{\sum_{c}|L(c,E)|},
$$

where $Top_p$ are the top $p\%$ by $|L|$. Large $\sigma_{sub}$ with reasonable influence inequality is a sign of field self-recovery capacity.

---

## 4. Inter-Environmental Transport

A trace has a **global profile** $\mathbf{L}(c)=\{L(c,E_1),...,L(c,E_n)\}$. Transfer between environments is described by coefficient

$$
\tau(c,E_i\!\to\!E_j)\in[0,1],
$$

depending on semantic translatability, institutional bridge presence, and audience compatibility. Effect:

$$
L(c,E_j)\ \leftarrow\ L(c,E_j)+\tau(c,E_i\!\to\!E_j)\cdot L(c,E_i)\cdot \kappa(E_j,t).
$$

Transfer types: vertical (foundation↔practice), horizontal (related scenes), diagonal (distant domains).

---

## 5. Valence and Health of Interactions

Valence $\chi(c,E)$ aggregates trace influence on environment's freedom components:

$$
\chi=\gamma_T\widehat{\Delta T}+\gamma_A\widehat{\Delta A}+\gamma_K\widehat{\Delta K}+\gamma_S\widehat{\Delta S}\in[-1,1],
$$

where $\Delta T,\Delta A,\Delta K,\Delta S$ are changes in will/resonance/order/capabilities, $\gamma$ are weights.
Positive interactions with $\chi>0$ increase $\rho_L$ and strengthen the ecosystem. (Negative modes — parasitism/mimicry — deferred to subsequent papers.)

---

## 6. Mini-Case (Sketch, Without Data Details)

* Built semantic map $\Sigma$ of one environment over 10 years.
* Estimated $a,b,c,d$ via log-regression on first 8 years, validation on last 2 — coefficient stability preserved.
* Conducted event-study on 10 "lighthouses" (events): found significant $\widehat{\lambda}_{\text{syn}}$ for bridge connections and $\widehat{\lambda}_{\text{shield}}$ for competing releases in same channel.
* Simulation of adding bridge trace increases $\rho_L$ and $\sigma_{sub}$ over 6-12 month horizon.

(Full methodology and calculation templates in Appendix.)

---

## 7. Practical Implications

* **For science.** Pointedly support bridge lines, reducing shielding (parallelizing recognition channels).
* **For platforms.** Ranking with cluster diversity regularizer, A/B bridges → growth in synergy and composites.
* **For cultural policy.** "Rehabilitation" programs and substrate support ($\sigma_{sub}\uparrow$) increase field stability.

---

## 8. Limitations and Plans

* Parasitic fields, recognition mimicry, toxic traces ($\chi<0$) — in next paper.
* In this work, parameters calibrated on one/several environments; transferability requires hierarchical estimation (see Appendix §B).

---

## 9. Conclusion

Trace interactions are the main mechanism of field evolution and stability. Individual trace strength is important to understand **in environmental context** and its bridges. Balanced recognition channel architecture and long-tail support increase vitality and field capacity for self-renewal.

**A1. Semantics $\Sigma$.**

* Embeddings (Sentence-BERT/domain-specific), reduction (UMAP), clustering (HDBSCAN/Leiden).
* Thematic validity: expert annotation (Delphi round), cluster stability (ARI/NMI).

**A2. Validators $R_E$.**

* Explicit institutions (journals/scenes/standards) + hidden influence nodes (KOL graph).
* Node weight: PageRank + expert competence scale; bias checking.

**A3. Memory/transmission $P_E$.**

* Carriers: repositories/archives/playlists/curricula/standards.
* Metrics: half-life of inclusion, fraction of artifacts with stable replication (forks/covers/citations).

**A4. Norms $H_E$.**

* Proxies: fraction of reasoned reviews, appeal procedure presence, controversiality index (discourse tone), open codes.
* Latent assessment: factor analysis (PCA/IRT) → "permeability/openness".

**A5. Receptivity $\kappa(E,t)$.**

* New author influx, cross-cluster collaborations, innovation adoption speed (time to implementation).

---

### §B. Calibration of $(a,b,c,d)$

**B1. Data.**
Trace corpus $c$ with scales $\eta,R,P,\rho$ and target success variable $Y$ (stable citations/repertoire share/code dependency fraction, etc.).

**B2. Model.**

$$
\log Y = a\log \eta + b\log R + c\log P + d\log \rho + \theta + \varepsilon.
$$

* Estimation: Elastic Net / hierarchical Bayesian (levels — subgenres/subareas).
* Validation: K-fold + out-of-time (last 20% of time).
* Stability: bootstrap confidence intervals; subdomain comparison.

**B3. Alternatives.**

* Multi-criteria optimization (if $Y$ is multidimensional).
* Robust regressions (Huber) for long tails.

---

### §C. Estimation of Interaction Coefficients $\lambda_{\*}$

**C1. Event-study.**
Select "lighthouses" (releases/standards). Measure $\Delta L$ of neighboring traces before/after event, comparing with control (similar clusters without event).

**C2. Granger causality.**
On time series pair $\{L_i(t),L_j(t)\}$ test whether lags of one improve prediction of other → estimate $\widehat{\lambda}_{\text{syn}}$.

**C3. Synthetic control.**
Construct counterfactual "similar field" and estimate shift in $\rho_L$, $\sigma_{sub}$ after bridge implementation → $\widehat{\lambda}_{\text{frame}}$.

**C4. Network A/B.**
On platforms: enabling "bridge" recommendations vs status quo; target metrics — shield effect reduction and composite growth.

---

### §D. Inter-Environmental Transport $\tau$

**D1. Estimation of $\tau(c,E_i\!\to\!E_j)$.**

* Citation/cover/dependency flows between environment clusters.
* Logit model of transfer probability with features: semantic distance, institutional bridge presence, audience overlap.

**D2. Robustness checking.**

* Hard/soft clustering of $\Sigma$, alternative distance metrics, cross-validation of periods.

---

### §E. Valence $\chi(c,E)$

$$
\chi=\gamma_T\widehat{\Delta T}+\gamma_A\widehat{\Delta A}+\gamma_K\widehat{\Delta K}+\gamma_S\widehat{\Delta S}.
$$

* $\Delta T$ indicators: growth in initiative acts/self-organization share.
* $\Delta A$: increase in bilateral recognitions (dialogues/joint works).
* $\Delta K$: improved rule transparency/appeal accessibility.
* $\Delta S$: expansion of tools/skills/access.
  Normalization to $[-1,1]$; weights $\gamma$ aligned with environment priorities (expert consensus).
