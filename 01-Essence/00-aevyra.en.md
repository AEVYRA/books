## § 0. On the Field of Aevyra (*De Campo Aevyrae*)

---

### **Axiom (AX-ES-0.1)**

$$
\Aevyra := \{F \;|\; F = f(\Thyraen, Kareth, Selvath, Arivath, Essithar, Lirynth) \}
$$

where:

* **Thyraen** — inner will (*seed of will*),
* **Kareth** — conditions and order (*external order*),
* **Selvath** — capacity to act (*capacity*),
* **Arivath** — resonance, union without assimilation (*resonant union*),
* **Essithar** — consciousness as path (*path of consciousness*),
* **Lirynth** — word as manifestation (*word as manifestation*).

### **Properties**

1. $$
   $$

F > 0 \iff \forall c \in {Thyraen, Kareth, Selvath, Arivath, Essithar, Lirynth} : c > 0
]
(The field of freedom exists only if all vectors are alive.)

2. If any component $c = 0$, then $F \to 0$.

3. Destruction of **Thyraen**, **Arivath**, or **Lyveth** destroys not only the subject, but the field itself.

4. **Orveth** is a distortion of the field: $F \to 0$ while the will is preserved.

5. Only through **Arivath** does freedom not diminish, but multiply.

### **Scholia**

Aevyra knows no prohibitions.
Its law is not a code, but a logic of co-belonging.

Whoever destroys the will or resonance of another — destroys their own presence in the field.
Here, exploitation is impossible without self-destruction.

Aevyra does not promise safety.
It promises that freedom cannot be built upon enslavement.

### **Strophe**

Aevyra — the breath of will in resonance.

Here neither chains nor commandments are needed:
the very act of destroying another's will
extinguishes your own flame as well.

The very act of consonance
elevates all together.
