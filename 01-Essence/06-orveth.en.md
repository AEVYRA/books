### § 6. On Orveth

**Axiom (AX-ES-1.11)**
\Orveth := {x | Will(x) ≠ 0 ∧ Energy(x → Other) ≠ 0 ∧ Lyveth(x) → 0}

Props.

1. Orveth(x) → Feyra(x) → 0 (freedom tends toward null).
2. Orveth(x) ∧ Will(x) > 0 → Surith(x) not necessary, yet effect similar.
3. Orveth erodes resonance: Orveth(x) → Corrupt(Arivath).
4. Orveth sustains False Kareth: Kareth(false) = conditions preserved by consuming others' life-energy.
5. Surith = absence of will; Orveth = diversion of will.

**Corollary.**
n ∈ \Aevyra → Orveth(n) ↔ {trace erased, field corrupted}.

**Scholia to AX-ES-1.11**
Orveth is not classical slavery. It is not defined by chains or death threats, but by the **systematic diversion of life-energy** into sustaining another's field of existence. The subject remains formally free, may even carry will — yet nearly all their resonance is spent outside themselves.

Thus Orveth differs from Surith. Surith annihilates will. Orveth permits will but redirects it, burning the trace (*lyveth*) into someone else's infrastructure. For Aevyra, this state is destructive: the enslaved decays toward silence; the master corrupts the field through parasitism.

**Strophe**
Not all slavery is chains.
If your life sustains another's comfort,
while your own trace fades,
this is Orveth.
It is freedom bent, not broken —
but bent so far it tends to zero.
