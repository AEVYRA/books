one_line: "Triadic affordance: a possibility that becomes real when capacity, will and permission cohere."
definition: >
  Feyra is the operational readiness of an act in a specific field, emerging only when
  (F) capacity, (W) will, and (L) permission jointly exceed their thresholds and combine
  multiplicatively into effective potential E = F·W·L.
usage:
  - "Raising will without permission does not yield Feyra (E stays low)."
  - "Training increased F, but L fell, so Feyra did not materialize."
ritual: "Let F, W, and L meet; then act."
