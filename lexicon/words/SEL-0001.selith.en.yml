one_line: "Inner mirror: the subjective perception of freedom, through which a subject reads its own Matrix of Feyra."
definition: >
  Selith is not freedom, nor will, nor consciousness.
  It is the light of freedom — the mirror in which the flame sees
  where to burn. Without Selith, Thyraen burns blind: energy exists,
  but direction does not. Or worse — the flame burns in a cage,
  but the mirror shows it open sky.

  Formally: M_perceived = Ê · M_real, where Ê is the perception operator.
  Essithar is the transparency of this operator: Essithar = ‖Ê − I‖⁻¹.

  The path to clarity differs for every mind,
  but the law is the same: a distorted lens always fails
  against reality. Actions do not yield the expected Lyveth.
  This signal of pain arrives from reality, bypassing the lens,
  and sooner or later returns the mirror to truth.
usage:
  - "Her Selith was clear — she saw both the walls and the sky."
  - "Captive Thyraen burns where Selith shows no walls."
  - "The collapse of Selith shattered everything he believed about his freedom."
ritual: "Selith non est libertas, sed lux libertatis."
aliases:
  - "inner mirror"
  - "freedom-perception"
  - "lens of awareness"
do_not_confuse:
  - "feyra: freedom itself, the field; Selith is its perception"
  - "essithar: quality of the lens; Selith is what the lens reveals"
  - "thyraen: the flame of will; Selith is the mirror showing the flame its space"
