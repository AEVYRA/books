one_line: "False trace: recognition that persists but corrodes freedom."
definition: >
  Suriveth is the shadow of Lyveth: a trace acknowledged,
  yet drained of resonance. It survives as memory,
  but its persistence erodes rather than sustains Feyra.
usage:
  - "Propaganda leaves suriveth in collective memory."
  - "Addictive algorithms generate suriveth instead of authentic traces."
aliases:
  - "corrupted trace"
  - "false mark"
