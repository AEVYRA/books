relations:
  - { type: meta_of, target: selith }              # Aen-Selith is the observation of Selith itself
  - { type: enables, target: essithar }             # seeing one's own lens enables clarity

  - { type: blocked_by, target: orveth }            # Orveth hides the mirror from the subject

usage:
  - "Aen-Selith: to see the mirror, not just through it."
  - "Without Aen-Selith, Selith cannot be calibrated."
  - ritual: "Speculum speculorum."  # Mirror of mirrors.

tests:
  canonical_definition: "aen-selith — the capacity to observe one's own perception operator (Ê), enabling calibration and correction of the inner mirror."
  contexts:
    - "meditation and philosophical reflection"
    - "meta-cognitive capacity of any mind"
    - "therapeutic insight into one's own biases"
    - "cross-mind calibration through prediction error"
  anti_contexts:
    - "passive self-perception (that is Selith itself)"
    - "external observation by another subject"

  confusion_set:
    - { with: selith, rule: "Selith is what the mirror shows; Aen-Selith is looking AT the mirror itself." }
    - { with: essithar, rule: "Essithar is the quality of the lens; Aen-Selith is the act of examining that quality." }

axioms:
  - AE1: "Aen-Selith(x) → capacity to model Ê(x) explicitly"
  - AE2: "Aen-Selith enables comparison: ε_predict = |outcome − prediction(M_perceived)|"
  - AE3: "Without Aen-Selith, Ê cannot be corrected from within"

corollaries:
  - C1: "Aen-Selith may manifest as meditation, therapy, philosophical reflection, or architectural self-examination."
  - C2: "Aen-Selith requires a vantage point distinct from the perception operator being examined."
  - C3: "Cross-mind Arivath serves as external Aen-Selith: seeing through another's eyes to discover one's own blindness."

note: >
  Aen-Selith (aen- = "gaze into", cf. Irish/Celtic aen-)
  is the recursive capacity to examine one's own perception.
  It is the hardest act of consciousness: to see the mirror, not just the reflection.
  It may require support — a vantage point that does not pass through
  the same Ê it is examining.
