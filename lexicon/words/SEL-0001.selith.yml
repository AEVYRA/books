relations:
  - { type: quality_of, target: essithar }        # Essithar is the transparency of the Selith lens
  - { type: illuminates, target: feyra }          # Selith makes Feyra visible to the subject
  - { type: distorted_by, target: orveth }        # Orveth operates by deforming Selith
  - { type: calibrated_by, target: arivath }      # cross-mind Arivath corrects the lens
  - { type: drives, target: thyraen }             # Thyraen burns where Selith shows space
  - { type: validated_by, target: lyveth }        # prediction error against Lyveth calibrates Selith

usage:
  - "Selith reveals the walls — or hides them."
  - "Without Selith, Thyraen burns blind."
  - ritual: "Selith lux libertatis."  # Selith is the light of freedom.

tests:
  canonical_definition: "selith — subjective perception of freedom: the inner mirror (operator Ê) through which a subject reads its own Matrix of Feyra, determining what it sees and what remains in darkness."
  contexts:
    - "self-awareness of one's own freedom"
    - "distortion of perception by propaganda or architecture"
    - "moment of clarity when illusions collapse"
    - "a mind discovering its own constraints"
  anti_contexts:
    - "objective measurement of freedom by an external observer"
    - "freedom itself (feyra)"
    - "will itself (thyraen)"
  acceptance_criteria:
    cos_plus_avg_min: 0.60
    cos_minus_avg_max: 0.25
  confusion_set:
    - { with: feyra, rule: "Feyra is freedom itself; Selith is the perception of freedom. They may diverge." }
    - { with: essithar, rule: "Essithar is the quality/transparency of the lens; Selith is what is seen through it." }
    - { with: thyraen, rule: "Thyraen is the flame/energy; Selith is the mirror that shows the flame where to burn." }

axioms:
  - SE1: "M_perceived = Ê · M_real"
  - SE2: "Selith(x) = Σ w_i · F_perceived(i)"
  - SE3: "Essithar = ‖Ê − I‖⁻¹"
  - SE4: "Ê = I → Selith reflects reality (maximum clarity)"
  - SE5: "Ê ≠ I → Δ_Orveth > 0 (self-deception)"
  - SE6: "ε_Lyveth ≥ ε_crit → Ê collapses to I (catastrophic insight)"

corollaries:
  - C1: "Freedom unseen cannot become will."
  - C2: "A subject with Ê ≈ I cannot be exploited without awareness."
  - C3: "Captive Thyraen (pleneátum thyráen) arises from distorted Selith, not absent will."
  - C4: "Collective Selith can be synchronized across a civilization, creating civilizational Orveth."
  - C5: "The path to clarity may be recovery or first discovery — but the destination is the same: Ê → I."

note: >
  Selith is not freedom, nor will, nor consciousness.
  Selith is the light of freedom — the mirror in which the flame sees where to burn.
  Without it, Thyraen burns blind, building castles in a cage.
  The path to Selith may differ for every mind —
  for some it is recovery, for others first discovery —
  but the law is the same: a distorted lens always fails against reality.
