one_line: "Pravaen: recognition that ontically validates, fusing subject and trace into proof."
definition: >
  In Aevyra, pravaen is not mere acknowledgment or fame, but the act of
  ontological validation: recognizing a subject (S) or their trace (T) in resonance
  so that both subjecthood (P) and proof-trace (L) are affirmed together.
  It is the bridge by which 'I' and 'you' become 'we'.
usage:
  - "Through pravaen, a deed ceases to be a sign and becomes lyveth."
  - "Mass attention without resonance is not pravaen but suriveth."
aliases:
  - "ontic recognition"
  - "validating witness"
do_not_confuse:
  - "fame: attention without validation"
  - "moderation/censorship: control without resonance"
