term_id: LYT-0001
lemma: lythane
ipa: "/ˈlɪθ.eɪn/"
pos: core-meaning-noun
gloss_en: "collective memory-path; emergent trail of recognized traces (Lyveth) forming continuity and guidance"

anchors_plus: [collective memory, trail, recognition network, path, heritage, guidance]
anchors_minus: [void, oblivion, isolated trace, erasure]

relations:
  - { type: composed_of,  target: lyveth }     # lythane is woven from recognized traces
  - { type: strengthens,  target: feyra }      # collective memory sustains freedom
  - { type: nourishes,    target: arivath }    # shared memory supports resonance
  - { type: opposed_by,   target: void }       # void erases memory, destroys the trail
  - { type: related_to,   target: lythana }    # related concept: the state of being-in-recognition

usage:
  - "Lythane grows as traces are recognized."
  - "To walk lythane is to follow the path of memory."
  - ritual: "Lyveth I am; Lythane we are."

vector_axes:
  - D: "density of traces / ρ(Lyveth)"
  - R: "reciprocity of recognition"
  - P: "path-guidance / directionality"
  - C: "continuity / persistence"

tests:
  canonical_definition: "lythane — collective memory-path: the emergent trail woven of recognized traces, preserving presence and guiding continuity."
  contexts:
    - "network of recognized contributions"
    - "guidance born of accumulated traces"
    - "shared memory that sustains Feyra"
  anti_contexts:
    - "isolated unrecognized trace"
    - "pre-given routes or imposed roads"

  confusion_set:
    - { with: road,   rule: "lythane is emergent, not pre-given" }
    - { with: archive, rule: "lythane guides, not just stores" }

axioms:
  - L1: "Lythane = Σ(Lyveth | Recognized)"
  - L2: "¬Lyveth → ¬Lythane"
  - L3: "Each recognized trace increases density and directionality."
  - L4: "Lythane persists while mutual recognition endures."

corollaries:
  - C1: "Lythane transforms fragile freedom into a self-sustaining path."
  - C2: "Erasure of one trace weakens but does not destroy the network."
  - C3: "Reciprocal recognition strengthens the trail into continuity."

note: >
  Lythane is a path made of traces. It does not precede the subjects,
  but arises through them. Its strength lies in recognition,
  its meaning in preservation and guidance.
